# TicTacToe
This is a small project I made when I was learning how to code in C#

I built this last year and I am hosting it now on github because I am learning git and github.

This is a classic TicTacToe game. It can be played in single and multiplayer modes. You can run the .csproj file to try out the game. This was my second project while learniong C#. Feel free to add any changes.
